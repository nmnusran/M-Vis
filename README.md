MATLAB useful scripts for optical data visualization

openCFM() will plot confocal fluoresence image (CFM) data

openESR() will plot continuous-wave electron spin resonance (CWESR) data

openWLS() will plot optical wavelength (WL) spectrum from spectrometer CCD readout. The calibration for the WL dynamic range has to be saved in spectrometerCalibration()
