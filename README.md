MATLAB useful scripts for optical data visualization

openCFM() will plot confocal fluoresence image (CFM) data

openESR() will plot continuous-wave electron spin resonance (CWESR) data

openWLS() will plot optical wavelength (WL) spectrum from spectrometer CCD readout. The calibration for the WL dynamic range has to be saved in spectrometerCalibration()

makeCFMstack.m  contains codes that can create a 3D view of 2D images stacked vertically. "ZoomFractal-30x30x6-um.png" is an image created using this code and some CFM data files.
